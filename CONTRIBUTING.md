# Contributing to Bernie 2016!

Hello and thanks for offering to help out with our tech efforts!

It may seem a bit overwhelming at first and unclear how to get started, so there’s a guide!

## Where is everyone hanging out?

We're on [Discord](https://discord.gg/0bmwNXGVZ2RZBGKJ)!  Why [Discord](https://discord.gg/0bmwNXGVZ2RZBGKJ) you ask?  For many of the same reasons that Reactiflux [moved](https://github.com/reactiflux/volunteers/issues/25#issuecomment-147538522) [there](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/10/19/reactiflux-is-moving-to-discord.html), the main ones being that it's super simple to invite people to and has free infinite chat history.  [Here's an invite](https://discord.gg/0bmwNXGVZ2RZBGKJ).

## What should I work on?

To get a sense of which projects are most active, you can take a look at https://github.com/Bernie-2016/ -- the projects will be listed in order of most to least recent activity.

The current priorities for the campaign will usually be the top pinned message in the Slack channel.  These are things we often need to get done very soon, so help is always appreciated!

If the top priorities seem too complicated and difficult to get into (they probably often will be for newcomers), feel free to instead trawl through some of our projects and try to find Issues marked with the ‘newbie-friendly’ tag.  Pick a newbie-friendly task (even better if it is a newbie-friendly task with a high-priority tag as well) and give it a shot!

## How do I commit a change to the project?

To commit to a project, please do the following:
1. Fork the repository
1. Make your changes
1. Create a Github pull request

That’s it!  If it looks good, we’ll merge it in and deploy it.  And don’t feel afraid to ask @saikat if you have any trouble diving in.

## Why are you doing everything in OSS? Isn't that crazy for a campaign?!

Other than the ideals-based reasons, which we do really believe in, we honestly think open sourcing our software is the best way to get as many people involved as possible.  We will win this campaign if we are able to make it as easy as possible for massive amounts of people to organize.  This is true just as much for our software as it is for every other part of the campaign.
