  Dear {{volunteerName}},

  Thank you so much for volunteering to host a phone bank event for Bernie. You are one of the volunteers at the forefront of the political revolution — and that's why we want to help you get ready for your phone bank event.
</p>
<p>
  Here's what you need to do to get ready:
</p>
<p>

   After logging in, you can view your event details and edit them if needed. Once logged in, you can also send out mass emails to communicate with all your event attendees.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. <a href="https://organize.berniesanders.com/call/{{callAssignmentId}}">Invite Bernie supporters near you to attend your event</a></b><br>

There are lots of Bernie volunteers out there — we have around hundreds of thousands volunteers signed up so far — so there are probably many Bernie volunteers in your area whom you have yet to meet.
